## 🔍 Detailed File Explanations

### **Root Level Files**

#### 1️⃣ **app.py** - FastAPI Backend Server

**What it is:** The main API server that receives requests from the web interface

**What it does:**
```python
# Creates a web server that listens for requests
# When a topic is submitted, it runs the entire workflow
# Returns the complete results (research, article, evaluation)
```

**Key Features:**
- 🟢 **Endpoint:** `POST /generate?topic=YOUR_TOPIC`
- 🟢 **Also accepts:** JSON body `{"topic": "YOUR_TOPIC"}`
- 🟢 **Returns:** JSON with all workflow results
- 🟢 **Error handling:** Catches and reports any issues

**How it works in detail:**
```python
@app.post("/generate")
def generate(topic: str = None, request: GenerateRequest = None):
    # Step 1: Get the topic from user
    actual_topic = topic or request.topic
    
    # Step 2: Run the entire workflow
    result = graph.invoke({"topic": actual_topic})
    
    # Step 3: Return structured response
    return {"status": "success", "result": result}
```

**What happens inside:**
1. User submits a topic
2. FastAPI receives the request
3. Calls `graph.invoke()` which runs all agents in sequence
4. Returns all outputs in JSON format

**Example Request/Response:**

Request:
```
POST http://localhost:8000/generate?topic=artificial%20intelligence
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "topic": "artificial intelligence",
    "research": "Key Facts: AI can process data 40% faster...",
    "article": "Artificial Intelligence: A Comprehensive Guide...",
    "edited": "Artificial Intelligence: A Comprehensive Guide... [improved version]",
    "evaluation": {
      "word_count": 750,
      "score": 100
    }
  }
}
```

---

#### 2️⃣ **streamlit_app.py** - Web User Interface

**What it is:** A web application that provides a friendly user interface

**What it does:**
- Creates a text box for users to enter topics
- Submits requests to the FastAPI backend
- Displays the final article and evaluation scores
- Shows any errors in a user-friendly way

**Interface Features:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Research Writer Agent          │  ← Title
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Enter Topic:                    │
│ [___________________________]   │  ← Input field
│                                 │
│    [ Generate ]                 │  ← Submit button
│                                 │
│ ─────────────────────────────── │
│ Final Article                   │  ← Results section
│ [Full article content...]       │
│                                 │
│ Evaluation                      │  ← Scores
│ {                               │
│   "word_count": 750,            │
│   "score": 100                  │
│ }                               │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How it works in detail:**
```python
# 1. Create input box
topic = st.text_input("Enter Topic")

# 2. When user clicks Generate button
if st.button("Generate"):
    # 3. Send request to FastAPI
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/generate",
        params={"topic": topic}
    )
    
    # 4. Get results from response
    data = response.json()
    result = data["result"]
    
    # 5. Display the edited article
    st.write(result["edited"])
    
    # 6. Display evaluation scores
    st.json(result["evaluation"])
```

**Error Handling:**
- If API server is down: Shows error message
- If topic is empty: User can't click Generate
- If API returns error: Displays the error details

#### 3️⃣ **llm_config.py** - LLM Configuration & Retry Logic

**What it is:** Central configuration for connecting to Groq's LLM with reliability features

**What it does:**
- Sets up the ChatGroq client with proper settings
- Configures HTTP timeouts and connection pooling
- Implements automatic retry logic (tries 3 times if connection fails)
- Provides a single reusable LLM instance

**Why it's important:**
- **Reliability:** If API call fails, automatically retries
- **Speed:** Uses connection pooling for faster requests
- **Timeout:** Prevents hanging if Groq API is slow
- **Centralization:** All agents use the same LLM instance

**How the retry logic works:**
```
First attempt fails (connection error)
    ↓ (wait 2 seconds)
Second attempt fails
    ↓ (wait 4 seconds)
Third attempt fails
    ↓
Raise exception to user
```

**Configuration details:**
```python
llm = ChatGroq(
    model="openai/gpt-oss-120b",      # Model being used
    temperature=0.7,                   # Creativity level (0-1)
    max_tokens=2048,                   # Max response length
    timeout=60.0,                      # Wait max 60 seconds
)
```

### **agents/ Package - Individual AI Agents**

These are the specialized agents that perform different tasks in the workflow.

#### 1️⃣ **agents/researcher.py** - Research Agent

**What it does:** Gathers factual information and research about a topic

**The Process:**

```
Input: User's topic (e.g., "Quantum Computing")
    ↓
[Researcher creates a prompt with the topic]
    ↓
[Sends to Groq LLM for processing]
    ↓
[LLM thinks about the topic and generates facts]
    ↓
Output: Research content (facts, statistics, important points)
```

**System Prompt (instructions given to LLM):**
```
Research the topic: {user's topic}

Provide:
1. Key Facts
2. Statistics
3. Important Points
```

**Example:**

Input Topic:
```
"Quantum Computing"
```

Output Research:
```
Key Facts:
- Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) instead of regular bits
- Qubits can be 0, 1, or both at the same time (superposition)
- This allows massive parallel processing

Statistics:
- Quantum computing market will reach $65 billion by 2030
- 60% of enterprises are exploring quantum technology
- Google's quantum chip is 1 million times faster than regular computers

Important Points:
- Still in early research stage
- Applications: Drug discovery, optimization, cryptography
- Major players: Google, IBM, Microsoft
```

**Code explanation:**
```python
from llm_config import llm, with_retry

@with_retry  # If fails, automatically retry up to 3 times
def research_agent(topic):
    # Create the prompt for the LLM
    prompt = f"""
    Research the topic: {topic}
    
    Provide:
    1. Key Facts
    2. Statistics
    3. Important Points
    """
    
    # Send to LLM and get response
    result = llm.invoke(prompt)
    
    # Extract just the text (not metadata)
    return result.content
```

**What the `@with_retry` decorator does:**
- If the first attempt fails (network error, timeout), wait 2 seconds and try again
- If second attempt fails, wait 4 seconds and try again
- If third attempt fails, give up and raise an error
- This makes the system resilient to temporary network issues

    ↓
Output: Polished, professional article
```

**System Prompt:**
```
Improve the article.

Fix:
- Grammar
- Structure
- Readability

Article: {article}
```

**Example of improvements:**

Before (Writer output):
```
"Quantum computing is a new technology. It use qubits. Qubits is different 
from bits because they can be 0 and 1 at same time. This makes them faster. 
The market for quantum computing is big. It will reach 65 billion dollars."
```

After (Editor output):
```
"Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational technology. 
Unlike classical computers that rely on bits, quantum systems harness quantum 
mechanics through qubits. These quantum bits possess a unique property called 
superposition, allowing them to exist in multiple states simultaneously—a 
characteristic that enables exponential computational advantages. The global 
quantum computing market is projected to reach $65 billion by 2030, reflecting 
growing enterprise investment in this transformative technology."
```

**Improvements made:**

### **graph/ Package - Workflow Orchestration**

#### 📊 **graph/workflow.py** - LangGraph Pipeline

**What it is:** The master coordinator that orchestrates all agents in sequence

**What it does:**
- Defines the state/data passed between agents
- Creates nodes (processing steps) for each agent
- Chains nodes together in the correct order
- Manages error handling for each step

**The Workflow Structure:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              STATE MACHINE                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                 │
│  topic: str           ← Input from user        │
│  research: str        ← Output from researcher │
│  article: str         ← Output from writer     │
│  edited: str          ← Output from editor     │
│  evaluation: dict     ← Output from evaluator  │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The Pipeline Flow:**

```
START
  ↓
[research_node] → Calls researcher_agent → Gets research
  ↓
[writer_node] → Calls writer_agent → Gets article
  ↓
[editor_node] → Calls editor_agent → Gets edited article
  ↓
[evaluation_node] → Calls evaluator → Gets score
  ↓
END
```

**Code breakdown:**

```python
# Step 1: Define the shared state
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    topic: str              # What user asked for
    research: str           # What researcher found
    article: str            # What writer created
    edited: str             # What editor refined
    evaluation: dict        # What evaluator scored

# Step 2: Create processing nodes (each node calls an agent)
def research_node(state):
    # Take topic from state
    # Call researcher agent
    # Add research to state
    research = research_agent(state["topic"])
    return {"research": research}

def writer_node(state):
    # Take research from state
    # Call writer agent
    # Add article to state
    article = writer_agent(state["research"])
    return {"article": article}

def editor_node(state):
    # Take article from state
    # Call editor agent
    # Add edited version to state
    edited = editor_agent(state["article"])
    return {"edited": edited}

def evaluation_node(state):
    # Take edited article from state
    # Call evaluator
    # Add evaluation to state
    evaluation = evaluate(state["edited"])
    return {"evaluation": evaluation}

# Step 3: Connect the nodes in sequence
builder = StateGraph(AgentState)

builder.add_node("research", research_node)
builder.add_node("writer", writer_node)
builder.add_node("editor", editor_node)
builder.add_node("evaluation", evaluation_node)

# Step 4: Define the flow
builder.set_entry_point("research")  # Start here

builder.add_edge("research", "writer")    # research → writer
builder.add_edge("writer", "editor")      # writer → editor
builder.add_edge("editor", "evaluation")  # editor → evaluation
builder.add_edge("evaluation", END)       # evaluation → finish

# Step 5: Compile into executable graph
graph = builder.compile()
```

**How it executes:**

When `graph.invoke({"topic": "AI"})` is called:

```
1. Initialize state: {topic: "AI"}
2. Run research_node:
   - Calls research_agent("AI")
   - Updates state with research
   - State: {topic: "AI", research: "...facts..."}
3. Run writer_node:
   - Calls writer_agent("...facts...")
   - Updates state with article
   - State: {...previous..., article: "...article..."}
4. Run editor_node:
   - Calls editor_agent("...article...")
   - Updates state with edited version
   - State: {...previous..., edited: "...refined..."}
5. Run evaluation_node:
   - Calls evaluate("...refined...")
   - Updates state with score
   - State: {...previous..., evaluation: {word_count: X, score: Y}}
6. Return final state with everything
```

**Error handling in nodes:**
```python
def writer_node(state):
    try:
        article = writer_agent(state["research"])
        return {"article": article}
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"Writer node failed: {str(e)}")
```

If any node fails, the error is caught and reported with context about which step failed.

---

### **evaluation/ Package - Quality Assessment**

#### 🎯 **evaluation/evaluator.py** - Content Scorer

**What it does:** Scores the final article quality based on objective metrics

**The Scoring Logic:**

```python
def evaluate(content):
    # Step 1: Count words in the article
    words = len(content.split())
    
    # Step 2: Initialize score
    score = 0
    
    # Step 3: Award points based on length
    if words > 300:
        score += 50  # Award 50 points if over 300 words
    
    if words > 600:
        score += 50  # Award 50 more points if over 600 words
    
    # Step 4: Return results
    return {
        "word_count": words,
        "score": score  # Max score: 100
    }
```

**Scoring Breakdown:**

| Word Count | Points Earned | Total Score |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 0-299     | 0             | 0 (Poor)    |
| 300-599   | 50            | 50 (Fair)   |
| 600+      | 50 + 50       | 100 (Good)  |

**Example:**

Article with 750 words:
```
word_count = 750
score = 0

Is 750 > 300? YES → score = 50
Is 750 > 600? YES → score = 50 + 50 = 100

Result: {
    "word_count": 750,
    "score": 100
}
```

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures minimum quality standards
- Encourages thorough, detailed articles
- Provides objective feedback to users
- Can be extended with more metrics

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### How to Modify Research Agent
```python
# In agents/researcher.py, change the prompt:
prompt = f"""
Research the topic: {topic}

Provide ONLY:
1. Latest scientific findings
2. Quantifiable statistics
3. Expert opinions from recent publications

Focus on peer-reviewed sources only.
Ignore opinion-based content.
"""
```

### How to Modify Writer Agent
```python
# In agents/writer.py, change the prompt:
prompt = f"""
Write a technical article (1000-1500 words) from: {research}

Structure as:
- Abstract (100 words)
- Introduction with context
- Problem statement
- Solution/Approach
- Benefits and implications
- Limitations
- Conclusion

Use academic tone. Include citations where possible.
"""
```

### How to Modify Evaluator
```python
# In evaluation/evaluator.py, enhance scoring:
def evaluate(content):
    words = len(content.split())
    sentences = len(content.split('.'))
    
    score = 0
    
    # Length scoring
    if words > 400: score += 25
    if words > 800: score += 25
    
    # Readability scoring
    avg_word_len = sum(len(w) for w in content.split()) / len(content.split())
    if 4 < avg_word_len < 6: score += 20  # Good word length
    
    # Structure scoring
    if '\n' in content: score += 15  # Has sections
    
    # Professional language
    pro_words = ['moreover', 'therefore', 'consequently', 'furthermore']
    if any(w in content.lower() for w in pro_words): score += 15
    
    return {
        "word_count": words,
        "avg_word_length": avg_word_len,
        "sentence_count": sentences,
        "score": min(100, max(0, score))
    }
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **API Key Required:** Must set `GROQ_API_KEY` in `.env` file
2. **Internet Connection:** Requires connection to Groq API
3. **Rate Limits:** Groq API may have rate limits on free tier
4. **Sequential Processing:** Agents run one after another (not in parallel)
5. **Token Limits:** Each LLM call has a maximum token limit
6. **Cost:** Using Groq API may incur costs depending on your plan

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| `GROQ_API_KEY not found` | Create `.env` file with your API key |
| `Connection refused` on port 8000 | Start FastAPI: `uvicorn app:app --reload` |
| `Connection refused` on Streamlit | Start Streamlit: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` |
| 500 error from API | Check if Groq API is responding, check API key validity |
| Timeout errors | Increase timeout in `llm_config.py` |
| Out of memory | Process shorter topics or reduce model size |
